    XML::RSS::Liberal - XML::RSS With A Liberal Parser

SYNOPSIS
      use XML::RSS::Liberal;
      my $rss = XML::RSS::Liberal->new;

      # See XML::RSS::LibXML for details

DESCRIPTION
    XML::RSS::Liberal is a subclass of XML::RSS::LibXML, for those of you
    who want to parse broken RSS files (as they often are). It uses
    XML::Liberal as its core parser, and therefore whatever broken XML you
    provided, as long as XML::Liberal can tolerate it.
